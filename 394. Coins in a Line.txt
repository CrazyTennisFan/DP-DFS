There are n coins in a line. 
Two players take turns to take one or two coins from right side 
until there are no more coins left. The player who take the last coin wins.

Could you please decide the first play will win or lose?

Example
n = 1, return true.

n = 2, return true.

n = 3, return false.

n = 4, return true.

n = 5, return true.

public class Solution {
    /**
     * @param n: An integer
     * @return: A boolean which equals to true if the first player will win

    public boolean firstWillWin(int n) {
        // write your code here
        if(n == 0)
        {
            return false;
        }
        
        boolean[] f = new boolean[n+1];
        f[0] = false;
        f[1] = true;
        
        for(int i = 2; i <= n; i++)
        {
            f[i] = !f[i-1] || !f[i-2];
        }
        
        return f[n];
    }
